## Authentication Solution Proposal

### Authentication Strategy

We propose using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** as the primary authentication mechanism for this platform. JWT provides secure, stateless authentication that works efficiently across multiple applications. Below is a detailed breakdown of the proposed strategy:

1. **User Registration**:

   - During user registration, a password is hashed and securely stored in the database.
   - Roles such as `user`, `vendor`, `admin`, etc., are assigned based on the type of user.

2. **Login**:

   - A user provides their email or phoneNumber and password to log in.
   - Upon successful login, the system generates a JWT token, which includes user details such as `id` and `role`.
   - The token is then sent back to the user and stored on the client-side (in local storage or cookies).

3. **Authorization**:

   - For subsequent requests, the JWT token must be included in the request headers.
   - The token is validated on the server using a decorator and Guards, which extracts the payload and validates its integrity and expiration.
   - The payload allows the system to identify the user, their role, and any permissions.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

   - The JWT payload contains the user role (e.g., `user`, `vendor`, `admin`).
   - Certain endpoints will be restricted to specific roles (e.g., only `vendors` can create products, and only `admins` can delete users).

5. **Token Expiration and Refresh Tokens**:
   - The JWT token has an expiration time for security purposes.
   - If the token expires, a refresh token can be used to obtain a new one without forcing the user to log in again.
